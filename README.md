# Cryptonite

## Introduction

Cryptonite brings [EncFS](http://www.arg0.net/encfs EncFS) and [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) to Android. You can browse, export and open EncFS-encrypted directories and files on your Dropbox and on your phone. On rooted phones that support [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) (e.g. [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/)) you can also mount EncFS and TrueCrypt volumes. TrueCrypt is only available as a command-line version at this time.

##Encrypt your Dropbox with EncFS##
###GNU/Linux###
This is simple and straightforward. The default packages should work just fine. There's a nice tutorial on [Webupd8](http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/encrypt-your-private-dropbox-data-with.html).

###OS X###
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org) provides EncFS and works just fine on all OS Xen that I've tested (10.6, 10.7 and 10.8). The MacPorts installation takes some time, but it's definitely worth it. Once installed, simply do:
```bash
sudo port install encfs
```

If you use homebrew:

```
brew cask install osxfuse
brew install homebrew/fuse/encfs
```

To make your decrypted folder look a bit prettier, use
```bash
encfs -ovolname=Dropbox -ovolicon=${ICONFOLDER}/dropbox.icns ${ENCRYPTEDDIR} ${DECRYPTEDDIR}
```
Let me know if you need a hi-res icons file.

###Windows###
[encfs4win](http://members.ferrara.linux.it/freddy77/encfs.html) works fine for me.

###Windows & OS X###

You can also use the cross-platform frontend [encfsmp](http://encfsmp.sourceforge.net/), if you don't want to use command-line tools.
